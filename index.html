          <h1>Hi, I'm Sam Richards.</h1>

          <p>---</p>

          <p>
            I'm a software engineer focused on web and smart contract
            development. I spend my days building dApps on Ethereum and seek
            projects where I can help push decentralized finance forward.
          </p>

          <h2>Background</h2>

          <p>
            I was raised on three guiding principles: <br />1) Never stop
            learning <br />2) Choose courage over comfort <br />3) Hakuna Matata
          </p>
          <p>
            I earned a business degree and scholarship while operating
            <a href="http://www.wakewashwfu.com/">my own startup</a>, a venture
            that generated six-figure profits and led to a fascination with
            software development and internet marketing.
          </p>
          <p>
            After graduating in 2012, I managed web analytics and SEO on behalf
            of large consumer brands at
            <a href="https://www.redventures.com/">Red Ventures</a>. Programming
            became a passion as I rapidly deployed marketing websites, built
            internal tools, and automated tasks such as email reports, web
            crawls and SQL dashboards.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2014 I moved to San Francisco for a 12-week bootcamp to pursue
            software engineering full time.
          </p>
          <p>
            For over 3 years I was a product engineer at
            <a href="https://neighborly.com/">Neighborly</a>, where I built a
            municipal bond investment platform. Our technology on-boarded tens
            of city and state government partners and transacted over $100
            million of securities to thousands of local, individual investors. I
            encountered first-hand the
            <a
              href="https://gendal.me/2014/01/05/a-simple-explanation-of-how-shares-move-around-the-securities-settlement-system/"
              >inefficiencies of our current capital markets</a
            >, encumbered by legacy systems and unnecessary middlemen. I gained
            technical exposure to real-world blockchain applications and found
            inspiration in the potential of decentralized systems to democratize
            access to the opaque world of finance.
          </p>

          <p>
            After diving deep into Ethereum dApp development with my own
            personal projects, like
            <a href="https://etherview.io">Etherview.io</a>, I'm seeking
            opportunities where I can continue to push the open finance movement
            forward and create a more transparent, equitable world.
          </p>
