          <p><strong>Greetings!</strong></p>
          <p>Iâ€™m Sam Richards. Thanks for stopping by.</p>

          <p>---</p>

          <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
          <p>
            I'm a software engineer focused on blockchain and web development. I
            spend my days building dApps on Ethereum and seek contract
            opportunities to help push decentralized finance forward.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Background</strong></p>

          <p>
            I was raised on three guiding principles: <br />1) Never stop
            learning <br />2) Choose courage over comfort <br />3) Hakuna Matata
          </p>
          <p>
            I earned a business degree and scholarship while operating
            <a href="http://www.wakewashwfu.com/">my own startup</a>, a venture
            that generated six-figure profits and led to a fascination with
            software development and internet marketing.
          </p>
          <p>
            After graduating in 2012, I managed web analytics and SEO on behalf
            of large consumer brands at
            <a href="https://www.redventures.com/">Red Ventures</a>. Programming
            became a passion as I rapidly deployed marketing websites, built
            internal tools, and automated tasks such as email reports, web
            crawls and SQL dashboards.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2014 I moved to San Francisco for a 12-week bootcamp to pursue
            software engineering full time.
          </p>
          <p>
            For over 3 years I was a product engineer at
            <a href="https://neighborly.com/">Neighborly</a>, where I built a
            municipal bond investment platform to democratize access to public
            finance. Our technology on-boarded tens of city and state government
            partners and transacted over $100 million of securities to local,
            individual investors. I encountered first-hand the inefficiencies of
            our current capital markets, encumbered by legacy systems and
            unnecessary middlemen. I gained exposure to the technical
            development of blockchain applications and found inspiration in the
            potential of decentralized financial systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            After months diving deep into Ethereum dApp development with my own
            personal projects, like
            <a href="https://etherview.io">Etherview.io</a>, I'm seeking
            opportunities where I can continue to push the open finance movement
            forward and create a more transparent, equitable world.
          </p>
